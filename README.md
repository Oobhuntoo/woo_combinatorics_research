The program discover_permutations.py does two things:

1. It generates all permutations of a given length.
    Example: Enter the number 3 in the terminal to see the following results: [1,2,3] [1,3,2] [2,1,3] [2,3,1] [3,1,2] [3,2,1]

2. It determines whether or not a given permuation is shallow and graphs its grid diagram.
    Example: Enter 4 2 5 1 3 to see if that permutation is shallow. Its grid diagram will also be displayed
